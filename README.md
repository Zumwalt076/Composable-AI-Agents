# Composable-AI-Agents
Exploring the potential of composable AI agents and modular NFTs to create dynamic, intelligent decentralized Artificial Intelligence

# Composable AI Agents

## Vision
This project aims to explore the intersection of AI and blockchain, specifically focusing on the potential of Composable AI Agents and modular NFTs (ERC standards like 6551, 998, 994 and more). The goal is to create a collaborative platform for sharing ideas, code, and resources.

## Objectives
1. Develop a foundational framework for composable AI agents.
2. Explore how NFTs can serve as modular components for AI systems.
3. Build a community to contribute ideas, insights, and code.

## How You Can Contribute
- Share resources or research articles.
- Suggest use cases or ideas.
- Collaborate on developing the framework.
